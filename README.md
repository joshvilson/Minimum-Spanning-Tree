# Minimum-Spanning-Tree

This project was an assignment for CS112 Data Structres. 

It follows Tarjan and Cheriton's round-robin algorithm, where partial trees are built and combined until only one remains: the MST of the entire graph. It then returns a minimum spanning tree given a graph object. The text files are turned into graph objects through methods in the graph class.
